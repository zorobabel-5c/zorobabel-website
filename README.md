## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

This commands outputs a node app at /build directory and can be run with

```bash
npm start
```

You can preview the production build locally with `npm run preview`.
